Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the 5th goal is Gender Equality. One of the targets to ensure Gender Equality is enhancing the use of information and communication technology to promote women empowerment. If equal participation of male and female is not ensured, the existing gender gap will increase the digital divide. Consequently, we will face social and economic marginalization. To avoid this marginalization, women must be actively present in the IT sector. Therefore, IT training for women, especially female students of schools and colleges is essential for introducing them with the dimensions of IT and guiding them towards a better future. To accomplish this goal, IIT Software Engineers' Community (IITSEC), supported by ADB, DUCSU and DSSE, organized a workshop for female students named “TechCrunch2.0”. A total of 60 college going female students participated in the workshop. Before participating in the workshop, all of the participants filled up a questionnaire about their perception and attitude towards IT sector. The data from the survey was used for a focus group discussion at the end of the workshop.
