According to the memo no. রেজি/ প্রশা-৩/ ১৯১৪০-িস, to celebrate the 100 years of University of Dhaka and golden jubilee of the independence of
the nation University of Dhaka has accepted the research proposal (স্মারক নং-রেজি/ প্রশা-৩/৪৭৯৭২) titled as
above. To do the research, we have arranged a focused group discussion with an expert panel of
discussants.

Fintech is defined as computer programs and other technology used to support or enable banking and
financial services. As we are graduating from Least Developed Country (LDC) to developing country, we
need to focus more on productivity, growth, innovation and inclusiveness. On top of that, financial
governance and efficient use of money are very important for sustainable economic growth. Two-third
of the population of Bangladesh are unbanked and they are not operating under any formal financial
channel. As a result, they are deprived of adequate financial services and are on limited for growth of
their well beings. On the other hand, Digital Bangladesh is happening. If we can plug-in the financial
sector with the digitization of the nation, fintech is very much possible. We need to do extensive
research about the current financial ecosystem and how technology can be integrated and gives us a
synergy effect. We want to explore current fintech ecosystem of Bangladesh, readiness of people and
industry and how fintech can ensure sustainable economic growth.
